# Original In Saturn's Rings Image Processing System
Original software written for In Saturn's Rings. Downloader acquires the files through web scraping
PDS Imaging sites, and the Controller converts the images from NASA Vicar/PDS/FITs formats to 
32-bit TIFF.

This system is currently being rewritten. Please refer to https://github.com/rishenko/new_downloader/
